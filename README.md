# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection


OBJECTIVE :
------------
The objective of this project is to create a credit card fraud detection system capable of detecting and preventing fraudulent transactions. The project's goal is to provide financial institutions with a robust and automated mechanism to protect their customers from unauthorized and fraudulent credit card activities, thereby improving security and trust in electronic payment systems.

How to Detect Credit Card Fraud:
---------------------------------
->Anomaly Detection: Identify transactions that differ considerably from regular spending trends.

->Machine Learning Models: To categorize transactions as fraudulent or legal, use methods such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting.

->Feature Engineering: Methods like as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting can be used to classify transactions as fraudulent or lawful.

->Imbalanced Data Handling: Use resampling techniques such as oversampling or undersampling to address class imbalance.

->Model Evaluation: Model performance may be measured using measures such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC.

->Continuous Monitoring: To detect emergent fraud tendencies, use real-time or periodic monitoring.

->Human Review: To analyze suspicious transactions, combine automatic detection with human experience.

->Model Deployment: Use the trained model to identify fraud in credit card transactions in real time.

->Feedback Loop: Update and refine the model on a regular basis in response to fresh data and developing fraud strategies.
