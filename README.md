# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection


OBJECTIVE :
------------
This project aims to develop a robust credit card fraud detection system to proactively prevent fraudulent transactions. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, our goal is to provide financial institutions with an automated tool to safeguard their customers from unauthorized activities, thereby enhancing trust in electronic payment systems. By analyzing transaction data and employing methods like anomaly detection and machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting, we identify fraudulent transactions amidst legitimate ones. We address challenges like imbalanced data using resampling techniques and evaluate model performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC. Emphasizing continuous monitoring and human review, we ensure adaptability to emerging fraud trends. Our commitment to iterative refinement, informed by real-time insights and evolving fraud strategies, underscores our dedication to leveraging machine learning for societal benefit, particularly in safeguarding financial security in the digital era.

How to Detect Credit Card Fraud:
---------------------------------
->Anomaly Detection: Identify transactions that differ considerably from regular spending trends.

->Machine Learning Models: To categorize transactions as fraudulent or legal, use methods such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting.

->Feature Engineering: Methods like as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting can be used to classify transactions as fraudulent or lawful.

->Imbalanced Data Handling: Use resampling techniques such as oversampling or undersampling to address class imbalance.

->Model Evaluation: Model performance may be measured using measures such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC.

->Continuous Monitoring: To detect emergent fraud tendencies, use real-time or periodic monitoring.

->Human Review: To analyze suspicious transactions, combine automatic detection with human experience.

->Model Deployment: Use the trained model to identify fraud in credit card transactions in real time.

->Feedback Loop: Update and refine the model on a regular basis in response to fresh data and developing fraud strategies.

SUMMARY:
--------
In this project, we gained expertise in building a credit card fraud detection model with the power of machine learning. We harnessed a range of ML algorithms to create this model, complete with visual representations of each model's performance. Our journey also encompassed the analysis and visualization of data, enabling us to distinguish fraudulent transactions from other data types effectively.
